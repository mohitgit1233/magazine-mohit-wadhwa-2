            <h2>Doctor Strange: Multiverse of madness has more characters than Avengers</h2>

            Doctor Strange(2016) co-writer C. Robert Cargill stated in April 2016 that Marvel Studios felt some initial ideas for the film from him and director Scott Derrickson highlighted too much of the "weird stuff" associated with the comic book character to feature in an origin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films.Derrickson revealed in October that he had plans for a sequel, expressing his love for the character and the visual possibilities that come with him. 
          </p>

          <p>Derrickson said the first film was "the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." He wanted to follow the example of The Dark Knight (2008) and introduce a villain in the sequel that would allow them to "go deep [and have] a more visceral experience". 
        </p>

        <p>
            Star Benedict Cumberbatch had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange film.Derrickson expressed interest in featuring the villain Nightmare, and further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir after their small roles in the first film. He also explained that he was "kept in the loop" on how the Avengers films were using the character due to his close relationships with Joe Russo—the co-director of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019)—and Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige.
             Strange co-writer Jon Spaihts expressed interest in seeing the character Clea appear in a sequel.
            </p>
            
            <p>"We honor each definition of the word 'madness' in this movie. For example, it's not just the craziness of what an alternate universe might look like, feel like, or sound like. When you see that there are infinite versions of yourself across infinite universes and you're a different person in them different facets of you rise to the top... Seeing other versions of yourself make decisions that you would not make can, for better or worse, be maddening [for any character.] Sometimes the scariest monsters are the ones that dwell within us. And with the multiverse, maybe some versions of us are more monstrous than others."
            —Marvel Studios production and development manager Richie Palmer on the meaning of the film's title
           </p>

            <p> In April 2017, Derrickson was reported to be returning for a sequel, beginning work after fulfilling his commitments to the television series Locke & Key.By December 2018, Derrickson had quietly finalized a deal to direct the sequel, with Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams reprising their respective roles of Dr. Stephen Strange, Wong, and Christine Palmer. Marvel was beginning to search for a writer, with The Hollywood Reporter stating that the script would be written throughout 2019 for a planned filming start in early 2020 and a potential release in May 2021.Feige and Derrickson officially announced the sequel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, revealing the title to be Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and confirming a release date of May 7, 2021.            </p>
